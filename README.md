 +Nat King Cole/Unforgettable---------------+
 | Original                                 |
 +------------------------------------------+
 | Unforgettable, that's what you are       |
 | Unforgettable though near or far         |
 | Like a song of love that clings to me    |
 | How the thought of you does things to me |
 | Never before has someone been more       |
 |                                          |
 | Unforgettable in every way               |
 | And forever more, that's how you'll stay |
 | That's why, darling, it's incredible     |
 | That someone so Unforgettable            |
 | Thinks that I am Unforgettable too       |
 |                                          |
 | Unforgettable in every way               |
 | And forever more, that's how you'll stay |
 | That's why, darling, it's incredible     |
 | That someone so Unforgettable            |
 | Thinks that I am Unforgettable too       |

 | Unforgettable, that's what you are       | Inolvidable, eso es lo que eres             |
 | Unforgettable though near or far         | Inolvidable, estés cerca o lejos            |
 | Like a song of love that clings to me    | Como una canción de amor que se aferra a mi |
 | How the thought of you does things to me | ¿Como pensar en ti me hace cosas que        |
 | Never before has someone been more       | nunca nadie había logrado antes?            |

 | Unforgettable in every way               | Inolvidable en toda forma                   |
 | And forever more, that's how you'll stay | Y por siempre, así es como te quedaras      |
 | That's why, darling, it's incredible     | Por eso, amor, es increible                 |
 | That someone so Unforgettable            | Que alguien tan inolvidable                 |
 | Thinks that I am Unforgettable too       | Piense que yo también soy inolvidable       |
